## Paper Submission and Templates

We accept long papers (describing substantial original research) of up to eight (8) pages and short papers (making a small, focused contribution) of up to four (4) pages. If a paper is accepted, the authors will be given an additional page to address reviewersâ€™ comments in the final version. The ethics statement (optional), limitations (optional), references, and appendices do not count against these limits. The ARR commitment link is [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=DMR/2025_ARR_Commitment), while the direct submission link is [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=DMR/2025). Papers should adhere to the following guidelines (from ACL Rolling Review):
- [Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#instructions-for-two-way-anonymized-review)
- [Authorship](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#authorship)
- [Citation and Comparison](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#citation-and-comparison)

Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) (Latex and Word). Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.
